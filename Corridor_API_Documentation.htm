<h1>Corridor API Documentation</h1>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Overview</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Corridor API is a programming interface to
 the Corridor business logic and to the Corridor back-end Oracle database.
 The API is distributed as a Win32 lib file named CorridorAPI.lib which
 contains dynamically-linked libraries for the APIs and the Corridor business
 logic. Supporting header files for C++ classes and other define files
 are included in the distribution as well. Interfacing with the APIs is
 through linking the library with an application. Applications interfacing
 with the APIs do not require MFC. The APIs do not have any UI aspects
 of their own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Corridor API can be used with Java applications
 as well. A Java wrapper through the Java Native Interface is also provided
 for the APIs. The process of using the APIs with the Java applications
 is well described through the example code and in further paragraphs.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conventions</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Unless otherwise stated, all String type
 data is 255 characters in length. When a data object is described as &quot;Must
 be valid&quot; this means that the value you are entering must exist in
 the database in the proper tables that hold objects of the type you are
 attempting to pass.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">High-level Design</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The APIs are designed to be generic and process
 oriented. They work with request and response objects. A request object
 contains a request type and a request data payload. The request type is
 string data and the request payload is a group of primitive data types
 like string, int, long, boolean, etc. The request object is processed
 and response object is returned in a synchronous manner. A response object
 contains a success or failure status flag, response data and/or error
 data. The response data is similar to the request payload. It is a collection
 of primitive data. The error data reported consists of one or more errors.
 Each error has an <a href="ErrorCodes/Errors.htm">error code</a> and
 error text. The request and response object format can be a Map (i.e.
 collection of name-value pairs), XML, etc…</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Session Oriented</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Interacting with APIs is session oriented.
 A session is initiated via a login process. The database schema name,
 user name and user password is required for the login, which authenticates
 the user and establishes the user authorizations based on the permissions
 setup for the user. Permissions are established at the initiation of the
 session. Any changes made to a user's permissions while the session is
 still active will not be reflected until the current session has ended,
 and a new session has been initiated. The Corridor API user passwords have
 distinct encryption. A utility method is provided to generate the passwords.
 Passwords created in the APIs will not be compatible with passwords created
 in the Corridor UI unless they are passed through the encryption utility.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Support</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Within a session one or more requests can
 be processed. Each request processing verifies the user privileges established
 during the login. Each request process corresponds to a transaction. On
 the successful processing of an add/update request, the data is committed.
 If the request throws an error the data is rolled back. This makes the
 sessions stateless.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold;"><a HREF="Sample_Code/Using_APIs_With_Java_Wrapper.htm">Using
 APIs Through Java</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The process for using the APIs through a
 Java Application is via Java wrapper classes that invoke the C and C++
 methods of the APIs. The <a href="Sample_Code/Request_and_Response_Maps.htm">request
 and response data</a> from the Java objects are translated to the C++
 objects <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->to
 service the API requests. This is accomplished via a Java native interface
 DLL file, RitaJNI.dll, created to support such access. You will need to
 update the PATH environment variable on your system to include the path
 to the DLL file.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Java wrapper constitutes of a primary
 class, com.continuum.api.RitaSession, which encapsulates the StartNewSession
 (), EndSession () and ProcessRequest () methods of the C++ APIs described
 earlier. Also the Java java.util.Map and java.util.List are used in place
 of C++ data objects namely, CRitaMap and CRitaArray. The following example
 code illustrates processing of GetUserRequest and a few code snippets
 to be used in one or more classes/methods as per your design. The session
 object can be constructed in a class and the generation of request data,
 sending the request using the session object and processing the reprocessing
 of the response data may be in a different class or classes.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">API Organization By Module</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">APIs
 are organized by Corridor module. Each API is used to manipulate, add, and
 get data that is pertinent to each module inside of Corridor. Use the Contents
 tab on the left to view all API requests for each listed module.</span></p>
